                          <p>In the night of the 12th to 13th October our crew was part of rescuing 126 people. The rescue was not only because it was pitch black outside extremely difficult, but also due to high waves and strong wind. The weather pushed the rubber boat back into Libyan territorial waters. Yet there was not much time to think as MOAS drone showed that one tube already bursted and people slipped into the water. Together with Proactiva, Boat Refugee Foundation and MOAS our RIB shuttled the rescued to the Phoenix. 17 people, among them a four-year old could not get rescued.</p>

As a group of young Europeans we trust in the power of a unified European commitment. We need to hold on to our democratic and humanitarian values which are unfortunately at the moment too often discussed and questioned.

                            Our crew of Mission Responsibility leaves Malta today to start their operation. We wish you strength and are grateful for your valuable service.
We decided on the name Responsibility as the organization, our crews, our ambassadors and our donors take responsibility instead of looking away. When people are forced to take such a dangerous escape route as there aren't any legal possibilities then the only thing left to say is that states fail to render assistance. #safepassage

Homeless  Aliyah ist am Ende ihrer Kräfte: Flucht aus Somalia. Durch die Sahara. Lampedusa. Without shelter and defence she was exposed to violence and abuse on the streets of Catania. - She could not bear that again. With their church asylum, the community Christophorus sets something against the authorities orders, and fights for Aliyah's story to be heard.
                          After the stageplay, we had the opportunity to introduce us. We also had an information stand there.
